# Robot_Challenge
This is my solution to the robot challenge.There are three files in this project.For the program to run place all three files in a folder.<br>
I have tested it in node.js v14.17.6<br>
1)Main.mjs This is the file you will run in node.js<br>
2)Robot.mjs This file contains the robot class and its method to handle commands like PLACE 0,0,NORTH,MOVE,LEFT AND RIGHT.<br>
3)input.text file contains test commands on each line.Note all command are in Capital letters.1 line spacing is provided between two commands.<br>
4)Please note output of each command is diplayed on the console.Screen shot of output is provided as output.png along with the 3 files.
